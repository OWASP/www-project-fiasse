## The Model

SSEM identifies all the fundamental attributes that are the building blocks of securable software in an evolving landscape (FIASSE RFC Section 2.1). These attributes are not merely abstract concepts but represent tangible characteristics that directly contribute to its overall security and resilience.

- **Maintainability**: Maintainability is the degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a product or system can be modified by the intended maintainers.

  - *Analyzability*
  The ability to quickly assess the impact of changes, diagnose issues, and identify what needs to be modified.
  - *Modifiability*
  The ability to safely and quickly modify a system without causing defects or reducing quality or securability.
  - *Testability*
  The ability to verify that a system meets its requirements and is free of defects.

- **Trustworthiness**: Trustworthiness is the degree to which a system can be trusted to behave in a predictable manner.

  - *Confidentiality*
  The ability to keep sensitive information secure and private.
  - *Accountability*
  The ability to uniquely trace actions to the responsible entity.
  - *Authenticity*
  The ability to confirm the identity of a user or system.

- **Reliability**: Reliability is the degree to which a system, product or component performs specified functions under specified conditions for a specified period of time.

  - *Availability*
  The ability of a system to remain accessible and operational when needed.
  - *Integrity*
  The ability to ensure that a system's data is accurate and uncorrupted.
  - *Resilience*
  The ability to recover from failures and continue operating.

The detail and structure of the SSEM are designed to align with the realities of software development, focusing on creating systems that are securable and adaptable to future changes. The SSEM aims to enhance security, maintain developer velocity, and improve software systems' ability to adapt to a changing security landscape while maintaining usability and performance.

**Generative AI**, like human developers, can be trained to produce software that is securable. However, this requires a clear understanding of the attributes that make software securable and developers must apply these attributes in practice. The SSEM provides this understanding, enabling developers and AI models to work together to create software that is inherently securable.
