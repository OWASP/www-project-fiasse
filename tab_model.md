## The Model

The Securable Software Engineering Model (SSEM) is centered on providing a design language that uses established software engineering terms to define the core attributes that make software "securable", which include:

- **Maintainability**: The ease with which software can be modified to correct defects, improve performance, or adapt to a changed environment. This includes the ability to **analyze**, **modify**, and **test** software for security vulnerabilities without requiring developers to adopt an adversarial mindset.
- **Trustworthiness**: The degree to which software can be trusted to behave as expected, particularly in the face of potential security threats. This includes the ability to ensure that software meets its security requirements and behaves predictably under various conditions.
- **Reliability**: The ability of software to perform its intended functions under specified conditions for a specified period of time. This includes resilience to failures and the ability to recover from errors without compromising security.

The detail and structure of the SSEM are designed to align with the realities of software development, focusing on creating systems that are securable and adaptable to future changes. By focusing on these core attributes, the SSEM aims to enhance security, maintain developer velocity, and improve software systems' ability to adapt to a changing security landscape while maintaining usability and performance.

Generative AI models, like human developers, can be trained to produce software that is securable. However, this requires a clear understanding of the attributes that make software securable and developers must apply these attributes in practice. The SSEM provides a framework for this understanding, enabling developers and AI models to work together to create software that is inherently securable.

## SSEM Usage

FIASSE is structured in a three-pillar approach. Those pillars are:

- Security Requirements
- Securable Code
- Application Security Assurance

The model has various uses beyond being standard terms to clearly define intentional attributes in software engineering. They also form the basis for a set of behavioral principles that can govern developers and code assistants. They can also ground security requirements, making them more relevant and actionable.

This framework intends to provide a general overview of requirements and assurance activities. There are standards and frameworks that generally guide these activities. High-quality sources exist for security requirements, features, and assurance guidance. FIASSE gives priority to software-engineering-level strategies and structured interactions with security teams in the context of requirements and assurance for long-term success.
