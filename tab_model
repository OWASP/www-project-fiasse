## Model

The Securable Software Engineering Model (SSEM) is centered on providing a design language that uses established software engineering terms to define the core attributes that make software "securable". These attributes are:

- **Maintainability**: The ease with which software can be modified to correct defects, improve performance, or adapt to a changed environment. This includes the ability to **analyze**, **modify**, and **test** software for security vulnerabilities without requiring developers to adopt an adversarial mindset.
- **Trustworthiness**: The degree to which software can be trusted to behave as expected, particularly in the face of potential security threats. This includes the ability to ensure that software meets its security requirements and behaves predictably under various conditions.
- **Reliability**: The ability of software to perform its intended functions under specified conditions for a specified period of time. This includes resilience to failures and the ability to recover from errors without compromising security.

The detail and structure of the SSEM are designed to align with the realities of software development, enabling developers to create systems that are not only securable presently but also adaptable to future changes. By focusing on these core attributes, FIASSE aims to provide a design language that enhances security, maintains developer velocity, and improves software systems ability to adapt to a changing security landscape all while maintaining their usability and performance.
