## Overview

CVE, CWE, and other vulnerability data often lack practical application or clarity for software engineers, making it challenging to integrate security measures effectively. FIASSE provides a framework to translate these concepts for security professionals, helping them better align with the business of software development. To maintain this alignment, FIASSE also suggests restructuring how AppSec teams interact with developers in some cases. The result for development is a set of transparent expectations, leading to the organic inclusion of security concerns in their engineering priorities. This approach ensures that security measures are seamlessly integrated into software development, preventing vulnerabilities that could lead to cyber incidents.

The project's process is distinct because it begins with First Principles, identifying engineering principles and attributes that inform subsequent strategies for developing securable software.

## Core FIASSE Principles

- The Securable Principle:
There is no static state of "secure". FIASSE aligns with security's First Principle continuously.

- First Principle Alignment:
While the Security discipline works to 'reduce the probability of material impact', the Software Engineering discipline works to 'resiliently add computing value'. FIASSE provides the structure and knowledge to dovetail these two efforts.

- The Derived Integrity Principle:
An application avoids implicitly adopting unmanaged context, such as data from the client, to preserve its integrity and prevent potential security breaches.

- Actionable Security Intelligence:
Instead of forcing development to make line-level mitigations that fail to address the source of the issue, security should strategically translate results to collaborate with Software Engineering on systemic flaws.

- Securable Attributes over Security Controls:
Rather than focusing on security controls or checklists, the emphasis should be on building software with inherent qualities that make it easier to analyze, modify, test, and trust.

- Participation over Assessment:
The Application Security team would be more effective if they actively participated in the development process rather than in assessment or reporting. The goal is to put what is needed for security into the design and requirements given to developers at the start. This makes assessment part of an iterative and empirical process.

- Business Alignment:
FIASSE facilitates Application Security's understanding of software development by aligning security measures with business objectives, ensuring that security concerns are addressed without disrupting development workflows. Structured alignment allows security to increase their impact on the security outcomes of development.
