## Overview

Pentest results, CVE, CWE, and other vulnerability data often lack practical application or clarity for software engineers, making it challenging to integrate security measures effectively. FIASSE provides a framework to translate these concepts for security professionals, helping them better align with the business of software development. To maintain this alignment, FIASSE also suggests restructuring how AppSec teams interact with developers in some cases. The result for development is a set of transparent expectations, leading to the organic inclusion of security concerns in their engineering priorities. This approach ensures that security measures are seamlessly integrated into software development, preventing vulnerabilities that could lead to cyber incidents.

The project's process is distinct because it begins with First Principles, then identifies engineering principles and attributes that inform subsequent strategies for developing securable software.

## Core FIASSE Principles

- The Securable Principle:
There is no static state of "secure".

- First Principle Alignment:
While the Security discipline works to 'reduce the probability of material impact', the Software Engineering discipline works to 'resiliently add computing value'. FIASSE provides the structure and knowledge to dovetail these two efforts.

- The Derived Integrity Principle:
An application avoids implicitly adopting unmanaged context, such as data from the client, to preserve its integrity and prevent potential security breaches.

- Actionable Security Intelligence:
Instead of forcing development to decode pentest results and testing terminology, security should strategically translate results and collaborate with Software Engineering on systemic flaw reductions.

- Securable Attributes over Security Controls:
Rather than focusing on security controls, checklists, or gates, the emphasis is on building software with inherent qualities that make it easier to analyze, modify, test, and trust.

- Participation over Assessment:
Prefer active participation in the development process rather than assessment, review, or reporting. This means security participation in architecture, design and requirements in whatever form that takes. This makes assessment part of an iterative and empirical process.

- Business Alignment:
FIASSE facilitates Application Security's understanding of business needs as given to software development. This ensures that security concerns are addressed without disrupting development workflows. Structured alignment allows security to increase their impact on the security outcomes of development.
