## Overview

CVE, CWE, and other vulnerability data are often impractical, even unintelligible, to software engineers. FIASSE provides a framework to translate these concepts for security professionals, helping them better align with the business of software development. To maintain this alignment, FIASSE also suggests restructuring how AppSec teams interact with developers in some cases. The result for development is a set of transparent expectations, leading to the organic inclusion of security concerns in their engineering priorities. This is about giving the machine the optimum fuel mixture to perform without bursting into flames due to a cyber event.

## Core FIASSE Principles

- The Securable Principle:
There is no static state of "secure". FIASSE aligns with security's First Principle continuously.

- First Principle Alignment:
While the Security discipline works to 'reduce the probability of material impact', the Software Engineering discipline works to 'resiliently add computing value'. FIASSE provides the structure and knowledge to dovetail these two efforts.

- The Derived Integrity Principle:
An application does not implicitly adopt unmanaged context, for example from the client. It does this to maintain it's Integrity.

- Actionable Security Intelligence:
Instead of forcing development to make line-level mitigations that never fully address the source of the issue, security should perform strategic security translation of results with the goal of collaborating with Software Engineering to address flaws as systemic issues.

- Securable Attributes over Security Controls:
Rather than focusing on security controls or checklists, the emphasis should be on building software with inherent qualities that make it easier to analyze, modify, test, and trust.

- Participation over Assessment:
We believe the Application Security team would be more effective if they actively participated in the development process rather than assessment, review, evaluation, or reporting after the fact. The goal is to put what is needed for security into the design and requirements given to developers at the start. This makes assessment part of an iterative and empirical process.

- Business Alignment:
FIASSE helps Application Security gain insight into the business of software development and how it addresses security concerns without derailing important development processes or adding toil. Structured alignment allows security to increase their impact on the security outcomes of development.
