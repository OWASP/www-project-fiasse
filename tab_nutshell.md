## In a Nutshell

CVE, CWE, and other vulnerability data are often unintelligible to software engineers. FIASSE provides a framework to translate these concepts for security professionals, helping them better align with the business of software development. To maintain this alignment, FIASSE also suggests restructuring how AppSec teams interact with developers in some cases. The result for development is a set of transparent expectations, leading to the organic inclusion of security concerns in their engineering priorities. This is about giving the machine the optimum fuel mixture to perform without bursting into flames due to a cyber event.
