The Framework for Integrating Application Security into Software Engineering (FIASSE) is a vendor-neutral approach to embedding security directly into the software engineering discipline. FIASSE (pronounced /feiz/ like 'phases of the moon') is a light weight framework that adapts to your existing software development processes. FIASSE provides a model and principles to create truly securable software by focusing on core software qualities. This makes your security efforts more effective, sustainable, and integrated with the development team.

FIASSE addresses persistent challenges such as slow progress in AppSec, friction between security and development, and the limitations of “shift left”. It flips the common AppSec model from "shoveling left" or expecting developers to "think like us". Instead it reframes developments relationship with security in terms software engineers already understand and can execute on.

With the rise of AI-generated code, which introduces new security challenges, it is more important than ever to have a framework that ensures that new software is inherently securable. We need a set of behavioral principles that can govern developers and code assistants. Security assurance alone is not enough.

This framework identifies low friction strategies to integrate security participation into software engineering practices. It also gives development clear expectations for the involvement of the security team. This reduces the friction that can prevent security from participating in secure by design activities.

FIASSE introduces the Securable Software Engineering Model (SSEM, pronounced /si:m/), focusing on how Maintainability, Trustworthiness, and Reliability contribute to security. This model enables developers to build software that stays resilient over time. It does not require them to have years of security experience or adopt an adversarial mindset. By aligning security with the realities of software development, FIASSE helps teams create systems that are resilient and adaptable, supporting both business objectives and security concerns.

## Fundamentals

While this framework attempts to give structure to the relationship between security and software engineering, the primary audience is Software Engineers. Therefore, the fundamentals are framed from that perspective to set expectations for development.

The core FIASSE tenets are:

- The Securable Principle: No static state of "secure"
- First Principle alignment: Resiliently add computing value while reducing the probability of material impact
- Business alignment: in the context of development, security aligns with the business through development's priorities
- Participation over assessment: security actively participates in key development processes

### Scope

FIASSE does not intend to replace existing security assurance advice like OWASP SAMM, OWASP ASVS, etc. Instead, it aims to complement other OWASP projects by integrating security more deeply into the Software Engineering discipline. It can do this by providing a structured approach to securing code through engineering practices. This will reduce findings and turnaround time, thereby decreasing the probability of material impact.

## Road Map

- [x] Establishment of project governance and contribution guidelines.
- [x] Use feedback to refine the framework and its components.
- [ ] Formal publication of FIASSE and SSEM specifications, including their core attributes and integration strategies.
- [ ] Development of an SSEM Primer/Introduction Guide to help software engineers understand the model and its application.
- [ ] Create a guide for Application Security practitioners on using and teaching FIASSE with relevant security requirements and code examples.
- [ ] Collection of SSEM adoption use cases or patterns to illustrate practical applications and benefits.
