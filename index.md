## "The Securable Framework"

The Framework for Integrating Application Security into Software Engineering (FIASSE) is a vendor-neutral approach to embedding security directly into the software engineering discipline. FIASSE (pronounced /feiz/ like 'phases of the moon') is a light weight framework that adapts to your existing software development processes. FIASSE provides a model and principles to create truly securable software by focusing on core software qualities and promoting fundamental Software Engineering capabilities. This makes your security efforts more effective, sustainable, and integrated with the development team.

It reframes developments relationship with security in terms software engineers already understand and can execute on. This gives development clear expectations for the involvement of the security team, reducing the aggravation that comes from last-minute security demands.

## Fundamentals

While this framework attempts to give structure to the relationship between security and software engineering, the primary audience is Software Engineers. Therefore, the fundamentals are framed from that perspective to set expectations for development.

The core FIASSE tenets are:

- The Securable Principle: There is no static state of "secure". Software engineers need to understand what is needed to create securable code without the years of extra training and experience it would take to understand the security practice.
- Business alignment: Security must align with development's reason for existing to engage with them. This means abandoning the "shovel-left" anti-pattern in favor of clearer communication and earlier collaboration.
- Participation over assessment: Structured participation by the security team in the development process yields better results than security assessment alone, which tends to be late and expensive.

### Scope

FIASSE does not intend to replace existing security assurance advice like OWASP PSCF, OWASP SAMM, OWASP ASVS, etc. Instead, it aims to complement other projects by providing a developer-centric framework. It does this by providing a structured approach to securing code through engineering practices.

## Road Map

- [x] Establishment of project governance and contribution guidelines.
- [x] Use feedback to refine the framework and its components.
- [ ] Formal publication of FIASSE and SSEM specifications, including their core attributes and integration strategies.
- [ ] Development of an SSEM Primer/Introduction Guide to help software engineers understand the model and its application.
- [ ] Create a guide for Application Security practitioners on using and teaching FIASSE with relevant security requirements and code examples.
- [ ] Collection of SSEM adoption use cases or patterns to illustrate practical applications and benefits.
