The Framework for Integrating Application Security into Software Engineering (FIASSE) project aims to address the persistent challenges in application security (AppSec) by fostering a developer-centric paradigm. Current issues include slow progress in enhancing software security, friction between AppSec and Development teams, and the inefficacy of simply "shifting left" without foundational changes. The rise of AI-driven code generation further necessitates a robust framework to ensure new code is inherently securable.

The FIASSE project will develop and promote the Securable Software Engineering Model (SSEM), designed to highlight security principles in the software engineering discipline. The project will develop a common design language, based on established software engineering terms. It will focus on inherent attributes of code and software architecture (Maintainability, Trustworthiness, Reliability) that contribute to security. This approach empowers developers to build securable software as a natural part of their discipline, without requiring them to become penetration testing experts or think like attackers. The project will produce specifications, guidance, and educational materials to facilitate the adoption of the framework.

### Road Map
* Establishment of project governance and contribution guidelines.
* Formal publication of FIASSE and SSEM specifications, including their core attributes and integration strategies.
* Development of an SSEM Primer/Introduction Guide to help software engineers understand the model and its application.
* Collection of SSEM adoption use cases or patterns to illustrate practical applications and benefits.
