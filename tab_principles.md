## Core Principles

- The Securable Principle:
There is no static state of "secure". Unmaintainable code cannot be secure over time.

- Actionable Security Intelligence:
Instead of forcing development to decode testing terminology, security should analyze results and collaborate with Software Engineering on systemic flaw reductions.

- The Transparency Principle:
Transparency is about showing clear, contextualized visibility into how the system operates, makes decisions, and handles data. This includes clear intent in architecture reflected in the implementation.

- The Flexibility Principle:
Software engineers value flexibility in code, as it can facilitate feature implementation and bug fixing. Attackers, however, seek uncontrolled flexibility as a means to force the application to deviate from intended behavior. Trust boundaries require heightened control over data and process execution. This concept should be allowed to influence implementation best practices, such as strict input handling.

- The Derived Integrity Principle:
An application avoids implicitly adopting unmanaged context, such as data from the client, to preserve its integrity and prevent potential security breaches.

## Core Values

- Securable Attributes over Security Controls:
Rather than focusing on security controls, checklists, or gates, the emphasis is on building software with inherent qualities that make it easier to analyze, modify, test, and trust.

- Participation over Assessment:
Prefer active participation in the development process rather than assessment, review, or reporting. This means security participation in architecture, design and requirements in whatever form that takes. This makes assessment part of an iterative and empirical process.

- First Principle Alignment:
While the Security discipline works to 'reduce the probability of material impact', the Software Engineering discipline works to 'resiliently add computing value'. FIASSE provides the structure and knowledge to dovetail these two efforts.

- Business Alignment:
FIASSE facilitates Application Security's understanding of business needs as given to software development. This ensures that security concerns are addressed without disrupting development workflows. Structured alignment allows security to increase their impact on the security outcomes of development.
